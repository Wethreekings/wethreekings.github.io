        <h3>Our Decree</h3>
        <p>We are three hobbyists and wargamers with a passion for recreating battles on the tabletop for exciting periods of history and fantasy worlds. 
           As many wargamers with quite a few years under our belt we though its about time to give the wargaming rules writing thing a go. 
           We want this page to be a place for wargamers to download and enjoy the many projects we have put together over the years.</p>
