        <h1>CALLSIGN: WARRIOR</h1>
        <p>CALLSIGN has been created to provide a simple, fast play, relatively inexpensive game for people to fight close quarters battles in the modern world utilising forces of around twenty to forty miniatures, and one to four vehicles, with games being able to be played in about 30-60 minutes.</p> 
        <p>Although many hours have been spent researching modern warfare, the game is not designed to be a simulation - there are many game designers that are much more skilled than we who have already covered this area. Instead, we chose gameplay over realism. Therefore, our objective is to provide players a framework to play a game using modern soldiers in fast paced games that have the feel of close quarters battles in modern warfare.</p>
