        <h1>ANCIENTS STRATEGY BATTLE GAME</h1>
        <p>Welcome to a simple project supplement for the Middle Earth Strategy Battle (ME:SBG) game produced by Games Workshop. To use this supplement you will still require the Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game RuleBook and its companion Army books for any additional special rules that would otherwise be listed in the suppliment.</p>

        <p>The aim of Ancients Strategy Battle Game was to simply take the core mechanics from ME:SBG and with minor variations allow players to field ancient armies. You will find additional equipment listed below as well as any amendments to existing rules. Other than this each of the army lists function exactly how ME:SBG Rulebook describes with the exception of Mercenaries which are covered in their own section.</p>

        <p>There is a huge range of miniatures available to wargamers for the ancients period but very few skirmish games to provide players a smooth transition from a few handfuls of models to the mass rank and file we are all used to. We have tried to include as many army lists in here to reflect most ancient forces you would typically see on the table. Of course depending on the reaction there is always room to include more. 
            </p>
        <p>We enjoyed the challenge of bringing these armies to a core system we truly love and hope others can enjoy them also. </p>
